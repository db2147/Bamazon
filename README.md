# Bamazon
This app is an Amazon-like storefront using the MySql database for storage.&nbsp; The app takes in orders from customers and depletes the store's inventory. 
<br>
Bamazon is a command line app (CLI) which means it functions inside the code editor and is not deployed to a browser.&nbsp; It utilizes the MYSQL and Inquirer npm packages as well.

 Here is a walk through of the app:

I created a connection variable in javascript to connect to the MYSQL database (bamazon_db).&nbsp; I also defined a port inside the connection variable which opens up a port on the local machine. &nbsp; This transforms our local machine into the server.

Happy Shopping!
